## Hangman - JavaScript README:

### Web Browser Hangman Game built in JavaScript

- This is a hangman game that runs in the web browser. It's built with vanilla JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.
- I built it while expanding my vanilla javascript abilities.
- I purposefully built it without using a JavaScript framework like Vue or React so I could gain a deeper understanding of JavaScript.

### Technology stack: 
- It is build primarily with Vanilla JavaScript and uses some HTML and CSS.
  
### Status:  
- I plan to continue improving this project (see todo section) but as is it is fully functional.

- Running it: You play the game in the browser using your keyboard.
